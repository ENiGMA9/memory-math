# memory-math
Unfinished React project to help memorize theorems &amp; math concepts. I started this to help me memorize math theorems and demonstrations for college but it's been abandoned, it works only halfway. The math part is done using KaTeX.  

The project is not designed to be made public on a website, it lacks authentication features as it was designed for personal use.
